<p>
This package contains components to model <b>1-dimensional rotational
mechanical</b> systems, including different types of gearboxes,
shafts with inertia, external torques, spring/damper elements,
frictional elements, backlash, elements to measure angle, angular velocity,
angular acceleration and the cut-torque of a flange. In sublibrary
<b>Examples</b> several examples are present to demonstrate the usage of
the elements. Just open the corresponding example model and simulate
the model according to the provided description.
</p>
<p>
A unique feature of this library is the <b>component-oriented</b>
modeling of <b>Coulomb friction</b> elements, such as friction in bearings,
clutches, brakes, and gear efficiency. Even (dynamically) coupled
friction elements, e.g., as in automatic gearboxes, can be handeled
<b>without</b> introducing stiffness which leads to fast simulations.
The underlying theory is new and is based on the solution of mixed
continuous/discrete systems of equations, i.e., equations where the
<b>unknowns</b> are of type <b>Real</b>, <b>Integer</b> or <b>Boolean</b>.
Provided appropriate numerical algorithms for the solution of such types of
systems are available in the simulation tool, the simulation of
(dynamically) coupled friction elements of this library is
<b>efficient</b> and <b>reliable</b>.

<p>
A simple example of the usage of this library is given in the
figure above. This drive consists of a shaft with inertia J1=0.2 which
is connected via an ideal gearbox with gear ratio=5 to a second shaft
with inertia J2=5. The left shaft is driven via an external,
sinusoidal torque.
The <b>filled</b> and <b>non-filled grey squares</b> at the left and
right side of a component represent <b>mechanical flanges</b>.
Drawing a line between such squares means that the corresponding
flanges are <b>rigidly attached</b> to each other.
By convention in this library, the connector characterized as a
<b>filled</b> grey square is called <b>flange_a</b> and placed at the
left side of the component in the "design view" and the connector
characterized as a <b>non-filled</b> grey square is called <b>flange_b</b>
and placed at the right side of the component in the "design view".
The two connectors are completely <b>identical</b>, with the only
exception that the graphical layout is a little bit different in order
to distinguish them for easier access of the connector variables.
For example, <tt>J1.flange_a.tau</tt> is the cut-torque in the connector
<tt>flange_a</tt> of component <tt>J1</tt>.
</p>
<p>
The components of this
library can be <b>connected</b> together in an <b>arbitrary</b> way. E.g., it is
possible to connect two springs or two shafts with inertia directly
together, see figure below.
