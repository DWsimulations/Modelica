<h3><font color="#008000" size=5>How to use SIunits</font></h3>

<p>
When implementing a Modelica model, every variable needs to
be declared. Physical variables should be declared with a unit.
The basic approach in Modelica is that the unit attribute of
a variable is the <b>unit</b> in which the <b>equations</b> are <b>written</b>,
for example:
</p>

<pre>   <b>model</b> MassOnGround
     <b>parameter</b> Real m(quantity="Mass", unit="kg") "Mass";
     <b>parameter</b> Real f(quantity="Force", unit="N") "Driving force";
     Real s(unit="m") "Position of mass";
     Real v(unit="m/s") "Velocity of mass";
   <b>equation</b>
     <b>der</b>(s) = v;
     m*<b>der</b>(v) = f;
   <b>end</b> MassOnGround;
</pre>

<p>
This means that the equations in the equation section are only correct
for the specified units. A different issue is the user interface, i.e.,
in which unit the variable is presented to the user in graphical
user interfaces, both for input (e.g., parameter menu), as well as
for output (e.g., in the plot window). Preferably, the Modelica tool
should provide a list of units from which the user can select, e.g.,
"m", "cm", "km", "inch" for quantity "Length". When storing the value in
the model as a Modelica modifier, it has to be converted to the unit defined
in the declaration. Additionally, the unit used in the graphical
user interface has to be stored. In order to have a standardized way
of doing this, Modelica provides the following three attributs
for a variable of type Real:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>quantity</b> to define the physical quantity (e.g. "Length", or "Energy").</li>
<li><b>unit</b> to define the unit that has to be used
    in order that the equations are correct (e.g. "N.m").</li>
<li><b>displayUnit</b> to define the unit used in the graphical
    user interface as default display unit for input and/or output.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note, a unit, such as "N.m", is not sufficient to define uniquely the
physical quantity, since, e.g., "N.m" might be either "torque" or
"energy". The "quantity" attribute might therefore be used by a tool
to select the corresponding menu from which the user can select
a unit for the corresponding variable.
</p>

<p>
For example, after providing a value for "m" and "f" in a parameter
menu of an instance of MassOnGround, a tool might generate the following code:
</p>

<pre>
   MassOnGround myObject(m(displayUnit="g")=2, f=3);
</pre>

<p>
The meaning is that in the equations a value of "2" is used
and that in the graphical user interface a value of "2000" should be used,
together with the unit "g" from the unit set "Mass" (= the quantity name).
Note, according to the Modelica specification
a tool might ignore the "displayUnit" attribute.
</p>

<p>
In order to help the Modelica model developer, the Modelica.SIunits
library provides about 450 predefined type names,
together with values for the attributes <b>quantity</b>, <b>unit</b> and sometimes
<b>displayUnit</b> and <b>min</b>. The unit is always selected as SI-unit according to the
ISO standard. The type and the quantity names are the
quantity names used in the ISO standard. "quantity" and "unit" are defined
as "<b>final</b>" in order that they cannot be modified. Attributes "displayUnit"
and "min" can, however, be changed in a model via a modification. The example above,
might therefore be alternatively also defined as:
</p>

<pre>   <b>model</b> MassOnGround
     <b>parameter</b> Modelica.SIunits.Mass  m "Mass";
     <b>parameter</b> Modelica.SIunits.Force f "Driving force";
     ...
   <b>end</b> MassOnGround;
</pre>

<p>
or in a short hand notation as
</p>

<pre>
   <b>model</b> MassOnGround
     <b>import</b> SI = Modelica.SIunits;
     <b>parameter</b> SI.Mass  m "Mass";
     <b>parameter</b> SI.Force f "Driving force";
     ...
   <b>end</b> MassOnGround;
</pre>

<p>
For some often
used Non SI-units (like hour), some additional type definitions are
present as Modelica.SIunits.Conversions.NonSIunits. If this is not sufficient,
the user has to define its own types or use the attributes directly
in the declaration as in the example at the beginning.
