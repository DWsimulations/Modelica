<p>This package contains basic <b>continuous</b> input/output
blocks described by differential equations.</p>
<p>All blocks of this package can be initialized in different ways
controlled by parameter <b>initType</b>. The possible values of
initType are defined in <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Types.Init.html">Modelica.Blocks.Types.Init</a>:</p>

<p>For backward compatibility reasons the default of all blocks is
<b>Init.NoInit</b>, with the exception of Integrator and
LimIntegrator where the default is <b>Init.InitialState</b> (this
was the initialization defined in version 2.2 of the Modelica
standard library).</p>
<p>In many cases, the most useful initial condition is
<b>Init.SteadyState</b> because initial transients are then no
longer present. The drawback is that in combination with a
non-linear plant, non-linear algebraic equations occur that might
be difficult to solve if appropriate guess values for the iteration
variables are not provided (i.e., start values with fixed=false).
However, it is often already useful to just initialize the linear
blocks from the Continuous blocks library in SteadyState. This is
uncritical, because only linear algebraic equations occur. If
Init.NoInit is set, then the start values for the states are
interpreted as <b>guess</b> values and are propagated to the states
with fixed=<b>false</b>.</p>
<p>Note, initialization with Init.SteadyState is usually difficult
for a block that contains an integrator (Integrator, LimIntegrator,
PI, PID, LimPID). This is due to the basic equation of an
integrator:</p>
<pre>
  <b>initial equation</b>
     <b>der</b>(y) = 0;   // Init.SteadyState
  <b>equation</b>
     <b>der</b>(y) = k*u;
</pre>
<p>The steady state equation leads to the condition that the input
to the integrator is zero. If the input u is already (directly or
indirectly) defined by another initial condition, then the
initialization problem is <b>singular</b> (has none or infinitely
many solutions). This situation occurs often for mechanical
systems, where, e.g., u = desiredSpeed - measuredSpeed and since
speed is both a state and a derivative, it is always defined by
Init.InitialState or Init.SteadyState initialization.</p>
<p>In such a case, <b>Init.NoInit</b> has to be selected for the
integrator and an additional initial equation has to be added to
the system to which the integrator is connected. E.g., useful
initial conditions for a 1-dim. rotational inertia controlled by a
PI controller are that <b>angle</b>, <b>speed</b>, and
<b>acceleration</b> of the inertia are zero.</p>
