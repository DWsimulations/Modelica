<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Eddy currents are induced in a conductive magnetic flux tube
when the flux changes with time. This causes a magnetic voltage
drop in addition to the voltage drop that is due to the reluctance
of this flux tube. The eddy current component can be thought of as
a short-circuited secondary winding of a transformer with only one
turn. Its resistance is calculated from the geometry and
resistivity of the eddy current path.</p>
<p>Partitioning of a solid conductive cylinder or prism into
several hollow cylinders or separate nested prisms and modelling of
each of these flux tubes connected in parallel with a series
connection of a reluctance element and an eddy current component
can model the delayed buildup of the magnetic field in the complete
flux tube from the outer to the inner sections. Please refer to
<a href="Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes.UsersGuide.Literature.html">[Ka08]</a>
for an illustration.</p>
