<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a flange for 1D translational mechanical systems. In the
cut plane of the flange a unit vector n, called flange axis, is
defined which is directed INTO the cut plane, i. e. from left to
right. All vectors in the cut plane are resolved with respect to
this unit vector. E.g. force f characterizes a vector which is
directed in the direction of n with value equal to f. When this
flange is connected to other 1D translational flanges, this means
that the axes vectors of the connected flanges are identical.</p>
<p>The following variables are transported through this
connector:</p>
<pre>
  s: Absolute position of the flange in [m]. A positive translation
     means that the flange is translated along the flange axis.
  f: Cut-force in direction of the flange axis in [N].
