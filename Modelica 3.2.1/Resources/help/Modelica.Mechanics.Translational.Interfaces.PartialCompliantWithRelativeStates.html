<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>This is a 1-dim. translational component with a compliant
connection of two translational 1-dim. flanges where inertial
effects between the two flanges are neglected. The basic assumption
is that the cut-forces of the two flanges sum-up to zero, i.e.,
they have the same absolute value but opposite sign: flange_a.f +
flange_b.f = 0. This base class is used to built up force elements
such as springs, dampers, friction.</p>
<p>The difference to base class "PartialCompliant" is that the
relative distance and the relative velocity are defined as
preferred states. The reason is that for a large class of drive
trains, the absolute position is quickly increasing during
operation. Numerically, it is better to use relative distances
between drive train components because they remain in a limited
size. For this reason, StateSelect.prefer is set for the relative
distance of this component.</p>
<p>In order to improve the numerics, a nominal value for the
relative distance should be set, since drive train distances are in
a small order and then step size control of the integrator is
practically switched off for such a variable. A default nominal
value of s_nominal = 1e-4 is defined. This nominal value might also
be computed from other values, such as "s_nominal = f_nominal / c"
for a spring, if f_nominal and c have more meaningful values for
the user.</p>
