<h2><a name="info" id="info">Information</a></h2>
<p>Version 3.2.1 build 4 is backward compatible to version 3.2.1
build 3, that is models developed with versions 3.0, 3.0.1, 3.1,
3.2 or 3.2.1 will work without any changes also with version 3.2.1
build 4 (see also issue (4) below, ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1757">1757</a>). This
version is a bug-fix release. Short Overview:</p>
<ol>
<li>This version of the Modelica package is <b>fully compatible</b>
to Modelica Specification <b>3.2 revision 2</b> (with exception of
issue (3) reported below and in ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1758">1758</a>).</li>
<li>About <a href="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Documentation/Version-3.2.1/ResolvedTracTickets-build-4.html">
10 tickets</a> have been fixed for this release. In particular the
following <b>critical bug</b> has been fixed:<br />
Ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1768">1768</a> fixes an
issue with block <a href="Modelica.Blocks.Sources.CombiTimeTable.html">CombiTimeTable</a>
(wrong output when using fixed time step integrator with time step
greater than table resolution).</li>
<li>Ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1758">1758</a> states
that simulation of <a href="Modelica.Fluid.Examples.HeatingSystem.html">Modelica.Fluid.Examples.HeatingSystem</a>
fails in Dymola 2016 if option "pedantic mode for checking Modelica
semantics" is set. This issue was not fixed in the library due to
the following reasons:<br />
The Modelica.Fluid library uses a particular pattern to define some
parameters resulting in a cyclic dependency of parameters if only
incident information is taken into account. According to Modelica
Specification 3.2 revision 2 this is not allowed (and therefore
Dymola 2016 correctly reports errors if the pedantic flag is set).
In ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1320">1320</a> this
issue was resolved for Modelica Specification 3.3 revision 1 by
allowing cyclic parameter definitions if the cycles disappear when
evaluating parameters that have annotation Evaluate=true.
Modelica.Fluid is correct with respect to Modelica Specification
3.3 revision 1. Changing the Modelica.Fluid library for build 4 so
that no cyclic parameter dependencies would be present anymore
would (a) result in a non-backwards compatible change and (b) make
the usage of Modelica.Fluid less convenient. For this reason
Modelica.Fluid is not changed. (Practically, this means for example
that the pedantic flag in Dymola 2016 needs to be switched off,
when using the Modelica.Fluid library in version 3.2.1 build 4 and
any previous version).</li>
<li>In ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1757">1757</a> it is
(correctly) stated that the example model <a href="Modelica.Media.Air.MoistAir.PsychrometricData.html">PsychrometricData</a>
was moved to another location and that this is a non-backwards
compatible change. This non-backwards compatible change is
accepted, because it fixes a circular depedency (a model references
a package in which it resides), for details see ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1679">1679</a>. Fixing
this ticket is seen as of much higher priority, as the small
drawback that an example model is moved (and the probability is
very high that this moved model is not used in any user
model).</li>
<li>In the release notes of build 3 it is stated that no models,
blocks, or functions have been newly introduced. This is not
correct.<br />
In package Modelica the following models have been newly
introduced:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelica.Mechanics.Rotational.Examples.Utilities.SpringDamperNoRelativeStates
(to fix ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1375">1375</a>).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelica.Fluid.Examples.NonCircularPipes (to
check the fix of ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1601">1681</a>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelica.Media.Examples.PsychrometricData (to fix
ticket <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1679">1679</a>).<br />
In package ModelicaTest the following models have been newly
introduced:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Modelica.Tables.CombiTable2D.Test19<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTable2D.Test20<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTable2D.Test21<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTable2D.Test22<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTable2D.Test23<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTimeTable.Test68<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTimeTable.Test69<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTimeTable.Test70<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTimeTable.Test71<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tables.CombiTimeTable.Test72<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MultiBody.PlanarLoopWithMove</li>
</ol>
<p>This release of package Modelica, and the accompanying
ModelicaTest, has been tested with the following tools (the tools
are listed alphabetically. At the time of the test, some of the
tools might not yet support the complete Modelica package):</p>
<ul>
<li>Dymola 2016<br />
Regression test results with regards to Modelica 3.2.1 build 3 are
available <a href="https://trac.modelica.org/Modelica/ticket/1681">here</a>.</li>
<li>Maplesim Parser</li>
<li>OpenModelica(Windows, Linux, Mac)<br />
Test reports for the daily builds are available <a href="https://trac.openmodelica.org/OpenModelica/wiki">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact difference between package Modelica version 3.2.1
build 3 and version 3.2.1 build 4 is summarized in a <a href="../../../Modelica%203.2.1/Resources/Documentation/Version-3.2.1/DifferencesTo3.2.1+build.3.html">
