# Modelica Standard Library

Free library from the Modelica Association to model mechanical (1D/3D), electrical (analog, digital, machines), thermal, fluid, control systems and hierarchical state machines. Also numerical functions and functions for strings, files and streams are included.

## Library description

Package `Modelica` is a free library that is developed together with the Modelica language from the Modelica Association. It is also called *Modelica Standard Library*. It provides model components and standard component interfaces from many engineering domains. The generous [license conditions](https://www.modelica.org/licenses/ModelicaLicense2) allow usage in commercial products.

Note, the usage of a Modelica library requires a Modelica simulation environment, [see the tools page](https://www.modelica.org/tools/), and that such an environment usually already includes the Modelica standard library. It is possible that the demo version of the commerical tools will not allow to simulate non-trivial examples from the library.
